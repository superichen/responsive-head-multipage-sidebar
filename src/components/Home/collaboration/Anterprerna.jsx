                <p>We are extremely proud to announce this empowering collaboration with AnterPrerna.<br/><br/>India is currently blessed with the concept of the geographic dividend. However, a noteworthy hurdle arises as a majority of the country's youth grapple with self-doubt, low skill set, and a lack of confidence.<br/><br/>In response to this challenge, Krishan Agrawal founded AnterPrerna, a platform committed to empower India's youth. AnterPrerna's primary objective is to provide high-quality training that nurtures their skills, enhances their mental abilities, and bolsters their self-esteem.
